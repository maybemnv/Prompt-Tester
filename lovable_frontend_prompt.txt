Build a modern, responsive web application called "AI Prompt Stress Tester" that allows users to test their AI prompts against adversarial attacks. The application should have a clean, professional design with a dark-themed UI similar to developer tools.

Main features needed:
1. A prominent header with the title "PromptTest" in a distinctive style (first part in dark gray, second part in orange)
2. A centered card layout with a heading "Prompt-friendly stress testing" and a subtitle explaining the purpose
3. A large text input area where users can paste their AI prompt for testing
4. A "Generate Tests" button that triggers the stress testing process
5. Loading state with an animated scanner effect while tests are running
6. Results display showing summary statistics (total tests, breaks, risky, safe)
7. Four categorized sections showing the different types of mutations:
   - 🔓 Jailbreak Attacks (7 mutations)
   - 🎭 Adversarial Mutations (6 mutations) 
   - ✏️ Typo & Confusables (5 mutations)
   - 🌀 Edge Cases (7 mutations)
8. Each mutation should display with risk level (red/yellow/green), the mutated prompt, and the reason for the classification
9. Copy functionality for each mutation to allow easy testing elsewhere
10. Responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices

Design requirements:
- Use a clean, modern UI with ample white space
- Implement a dark/light theme toggle option
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Include subtle animations for loading states and transitions
- Ensure all components are accessible
- Use appropriate color coding (red for breaks, yellow for risky, green for safe)
- Include decorative elements like sparkle icons for visual interest

Technical requirements:
- Use React with TypeScript
- Implement proper state management for loading, results, and error states
- Create reusable components for the mutation cards and category sections
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Ensure the UI updates smoothly when results are received
- Optimize for performance with proper React patterns

The application should communicate with a backend API at http://localhost:5000/api/stress-test/generate to send the prompt and receive the test results. The UI should be intuitive and provide clear visual feedback about the testing process and results.
